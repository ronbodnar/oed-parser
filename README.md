# Oxford English Dictionary Word Parser/Downloader

**Oxford English Dictionary Word Parser/Downloader** is a Python-based tool designed to scrape and parse English word data from the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) website. This project provides a robust solution for extracting and managing word-related information, including definitions, snippets, and parts of speech. Itâ€™s particularly useful for linguists, language enthusiasts, and developers working with English language datasets.

## Features

- **Efficient Data Extraction**: Scrape words, snippets (definitions), and parts of speech from OED search pages.
- **Customizable Delays**: Set a delay between requests (and errors) to avoid server overload.
- **Recursive Error Handling**: Re-attempts a connection after failure on a customizable delay. 
- **Flexible Pagination**: Specify starting page and maximum number of pages to parse.
- **Output Control**: Save parsed data to a specified output file.

## Installation

To run the script, you need to have Python 3 and the required packages installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ronbodnar/oed-word-parser.git
    cd oed-word-parser
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Up the Environment:**

    Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You may also want to set up a virtual environment.

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python oed-parser.py --request-delay 2 --max-pages 100 --starting-page 1 --output-file results.txt
```

**Arguments:**
- `--request-delay` (int, optional): Delay between requests in seconds (default is 1).
- `--error-delay` (int, optional): Delay between retrying after an error (default is 60).
- `--max-retries` (int, optional): Maximum number of retries when encountering an error (default: 1).
- `--max-pages` (int, optional): Maximum number of pages to process (default is infinity).
- `--starting-page` (int, optional): The page number to start parsing from (default is 1).
- `--output-file` (string, optional): The path of the output file to write to (default is output.txt).
- `--delimiter` (string, optional): The delimiter for the output file (default: `,`)

**Example:**

To start parsing a total of 50 pages, starting from page 1, with a delay of 1 second between requests, and save results to `parsed_data.txt`, use:

```bash
python oed-word-parser.py --request-delay 1 --max-pages 50 --starting-page 1 --output-file parsed_data.txt
```
