## Features

- **Efficient Data Extraction**: Scrape words, snippets, and parts of speech from OED search pages.
- **Customizable Request Delay**: Set a delay between requests to avoid server overload.
- **Flexible Pagination**: Specify starting page and maximum number of pages to parse.
- **Output Control**: Save parsed data to a specified output file.

## Installation

To run the script, you need to have Python 3 and the required packages installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ronbodnar/oed-word-parser.git
    cd oed-word-parser
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Up the Environment:**

    Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You may also want to set up a virtual environment.

## Usage

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python oed-word-parser.py --request-delay 2 --max-pages 100 --starting-page 1 --output-file results.txt
```

**Arguments:**

- `--request-delay` (int): Delay between requests in seconds (default: 1).
- `--max-pages` (int): Maximum number of pages to parse (default: infinity).
- `--starting-page` (int): The page number to start parsing from (default: 1).
- `--output-file` (str): Path to the output file (default: `output/oed-word-parser.txt`).

**Example:**

To start parsing from page 1, with a delay of 2 seconds between requests, and save results to `parsed_data.txt`, use:

```bash
python oed-word-parser.py --request-delay 2 --max-pages 50 --starting-page 1 --output-file parsed_data.txt
```
