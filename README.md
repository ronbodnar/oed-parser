# Oxford English Dictionary Word Parser üìöüîç

**Oxford English Dictionary Word Parser** is a Python-based tool designed to scrape and parse English word data from the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) website. This project provides a robust solution for extracting and managing word-related information, including definitions, snippets, and parts of speech. It‚Äôs particularly useful for linguists, language enthusiasts, and developers working with English language datasets.

## Features üöÄ

- **Advanced Data Extraction**: Efficiently scrape detailed word data including definitions, snippets, and parts of speech from OED search pages.
- **Customizable Request Handling**: Control request delays and retry mechanisms to manage server load and handle errors gracefully.
- **Flexible Pagination Control**: Specify the starting page and the number of pages to parse, with support for large-scale data extraction.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Save parsed data in various formats including CSV, JSON, and plain text.
- **Database Integration**: Load parsed data directly into a MySQL database for easy management and querying.
- **Error Logging**: Detailed logging of errors and exceptions for troubleshooting and debugging.
- **Dynamic Data Loading**: Supports loading data from local files directly into the database using `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`.
- **Environment Configuration**: Utilize a `.env` file for secure and flexible database configuration.
- **Minification Option**: Option to minify JSON output for more compact data storage.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work across different operating systems with minimal configuration.

## Data Outputs üìÇ

The following data files are available for download in the `data` folder:

- **`english-words.txt`**: Contains a list of just the words, separated by a new line.
- **`english-words.csv`**: Usable with the `load-data-mysql.py` script to load data into a MySQL database.
- **`english-words.json`**: Contains the word data in pretty (indented) JSON format.
- **`english-words.min.json`**: Contains the word data in minified JSON format.

These files were generated using the script and are available for download directly in the `data` folder on the repository.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To run the scripts, you need to have Python 3 and the required packages installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ronbodnar/oxford-english-dictionary-parser.git
    cd oxford-english-dictionary-parser
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Up the Environment:**

    Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You may also want to set up a virtual environment.

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

    ~~~
    DB_HOST=your_database_host
    DB_PORT=your_database_port
    DB_USER=your_database_user
    DB_PASS=your_database_password
    DB_NAME=your_database_name
    ~~~

    Replace the placeholders with your actual database connection details.

## Usage üìù

### `oed-parser.py`

Run the script to parse data from OED and save it to a specified output file:

```bash
python src/oed-parser.py --output-file results.txt
```

**Arguments:**
- `--request-delay` (int, optional): Delay between requests in seconds (default is 1).
- `--error-delay` (int, optional): Delay between retrying after an error (default is 60).
- `--max-retries` (int, optional): Maximum number of retries when encountering an error (default: 1).
- `--max-pages` (int, optional): Maximum number of pages to process (default is infinity).
- `--starting-page` (int, optional): The page number to start parsing from (default is 1).
- `--output-file` (string, optional): The path of the output file to write to (default is output.txt).
- `--delimiter` (string, optional): The delimiter for the output file (default: `,`)

**Example:**

To start parsing a total of 50 pages, starting from page 1, with a delay of 1 second between requests, and save results to `parsed_data.txt`, use:

```bash
python src/oed-parser.py --request-delay 1 --max-pages 50 --starting-page 1 --output-file parsed_data.txt
```

### `convert-data.py`

Convert the parsed data into different formats:

```bash
python src/convert-data.py -i parsed_data.txt -o output.json -f json -m
```

**Arguments:**
- `-i, --input-file` (str, required): The full path including the file name for the input CSV file.
- `-o, --output-file` (str, required): The full path including the file name for the output file.
- `-f, --format` (str, required): The format of the output. Can be 'csv', 'txt', or 'json'.
- `-m, --minified` (flag, optional): Flag to indicate if the JSON output should be minified.

### `load-data-mysql.py`

Load parsed data from CSV into a MySQL database:

```bash
python src/load-data-mysql.py
```

**Notes:**
- Ensure your `.env` file is properly configured with the database credentials before running this script.
